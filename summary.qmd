**Core Purpose & Scope:** The National Spatial Plan (NSP) is Kenya's 30-year framework to guide the country's spatial development. It covers all 47 counties and the Exclusive Economic Zone.

1.  **Key Functions:**

    -   Provides a spatial structure illustrating national projects and development patterns.

    -   Sets policies and strategies for organized, integrated, sustainable, and balanced national development.

    -   Coordinates sectoral planning (e.g., housing, agriculture, transport) and links physical with economic planning.

    -   Guides efficient, productive, and sustainable land use as mandated by the Constitution and National Land Policy.

    -   Supports the implementation of Kenya Vision 2030 flagship projects by indicating locations and managing impacts.

    -   Aims to reduce regional inequalities by recognizing the unique potential of all areas.

    -   Provides policies (e.g., protecting agriculture, conserving environment, urban containment) to guide county-level planning under devolution.

2.  **Addressing Challenges:** The NSP tackles historical issues like unbalanced development, rapid unplanned urbanization, environmental degradation, declining agriculture, underutilized resources, inefficient infrastructure, and lack of a national spatial planning framework.

3.  **Development Process:** Formulated through a highly participatory and consultative process involving national/county governments, professionals, academia, civil society, and international experts (e.g., from Malaysia).

4.  **Implementation:**

    -   Requires establishment of new institutions (National Physical Planning Council, National Technical Committee, County Physical Planning Committees).

    -   Needs budgetary support from national and county governments.

    -   Relies on coordination between multiple actors (national ministries/agencies, county governments, National Land Commission).

5.  **Significance:** Positioned as an essential flagship project under Kenya Vision 2030, crucial for achieving socio-economic transformation, global competitiveness, environmental sustainability, and equitable development across Kenya.

**In essence:** The NSP is Kenya's comprehensive, long-term master plan to strategically organize land use, economic activities, infrastructure, and settlements across the entire nation to achieve balanced, sustainable, and competitive development.
